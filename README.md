## Requirements

- Ability to add, edit, and delete books and store inside an array of book objects.
- Function to render books on a web page by looping through the library array
- Ability to display and change a books read status

## Bonus Requirements

- Use LocalStorage api to save and load books to allow for persistence. I incorporated
JSON _stringify_ and _parse_ methods to allow for easy data handling.
